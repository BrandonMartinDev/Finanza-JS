# Finanza

This project is a simple, responsive loan calculator app created with Vite + React JS :)

It is my first ever official react/vite project I have completed!

- By taking in information like a loan's principal, interest rate, etc. Finanza can calculate the average monthly payment and more!
- It even features a toggleable amortization schedule that will break down the loan's monthly payments on a month-by-month basis.
