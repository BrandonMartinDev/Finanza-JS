# Attention

I have decided to make Finanza a full-blown budgetting webapp. Instead of Finanza just being a loan calculator, my plans for Finanza will be a place for someone to manage personal finances. :)

The assets in this project (like the logo and name) will be kept the same, but the repository name has been changed to "loan-calc-finanza" to differentiate this small project from the bigger web app. If you're wondering why I have 2 Finanza repositories (loan calc and web app), this is why. 

Below is what the original README.md used to say.


# Finanza

This project is a simple, responsive loan calculator app created with Vite + React JS :)

This is my first ever official react/vite project I have completed so woo, what a milestone!

- By taking in information like a loan's principal, interest rate, etc. Finanza can calculate the average monthly payment and more!
- It even features a toggleable amortization schedule that will break down the loan's monthly payments on a month-by-month basis.
